Look at the following programs...

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

and...

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?

Answer:

The first program will print 3 to the screen, while the second program throws an error (NameError (undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object)).
The error is caused by trying to pring the x variable when it was only available within the scope of the block. If x was defined prior to the do-end block then the program
will print just fine.

Example: this program will print 3.

y = 0
x = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x
