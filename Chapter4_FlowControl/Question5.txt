When you run the following code...
def equal_to_four(x)
  if x == 4
    puts "yup"
  else
    puts "nope"
end

equal_to_four(5)
You get the following error message..
exercise.rb:8: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting keyword_end

Why do you get this error and how can you fix it?

Answer:
The error tells us that it's missing an end on the method definition. The code has and if-else 
block that needs to be closed. An 'end' after the else block on the same indentation with the if
and else keywords will fix this issue.
