#What will the following code print to the screen?

def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  return
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")

Answer:
The program will not print anything to the screen. Since the return was explicitly
called before the "puts words" expression, as soon as the return is ran by the program,
the method will exit and whatever is below the "return" will not be executed.
